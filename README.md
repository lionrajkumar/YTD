# YTD
YTD - Download videos and extract audios from YouTube.

### Note
The download speeds are too slow! I am getting less than 100KBps in a 100Mbps connection! Without faster downloads there is no meaning in using this.

### Update
accept a youtube short link like "https://youtu.be/5cpIZ8zHHXw", should update your downloaded index.php file
